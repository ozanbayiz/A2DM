### Data

run `get_data` to download the data (2.61 GB). `output_path` is optional, default is PWD.
```python
python get_data.py <output_path>
```
this will also delete invalid data (does not have 100 frames and two people)

### Visualization
run `vis_motion.py` to visualize the motion.

---

### Training
run `train.py` to train the model.

### TODO
better model architecture?
